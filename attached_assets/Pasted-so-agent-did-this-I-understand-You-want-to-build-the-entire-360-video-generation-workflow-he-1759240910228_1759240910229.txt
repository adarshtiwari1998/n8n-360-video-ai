Determined required API credentials
First, I need to collect the API keys you mentioned. Let me ask for them:

To build the complete 360° video generation system with Shopify integration and ImageKit image storage, I need the following API credentials:

Shopify Integration:

SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN: Your Shopify Admin API access token (for fetching products via GraphQL)
SHOPIFY_STORE_URL: Your Shopify store URL (e.g., your-store.myshopify.com)
ImageKit Integration:

IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY: Your ImageKit public key
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY: Your ImageKit private key
IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT: Your ImageKit URL endpoint (e.g., https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id)
These will be securely stored as environment variables and used to:

Search and fetch products from your Shopify store
Upload and store product images in ImageKit
Generate image URLs for AI analysis
You can find your ImageKit credentials at: https://imagekit.io/dashboard/developer/api-keys
