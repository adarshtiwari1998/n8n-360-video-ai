Perfect! I understand your strategy. This is smart - we'll send multiple reference images to Veo 2:

If product has multiple angles from Shopify: Send all of them
If product has only 1 image: Send the same image URL 3 times (as if it's different angles) to give Veo 2 more data
Let me implement this multi-angle reference system:


Planned additional image handling
Now I'll implement the multi-angle image system. Let me update the frontend to support multiple images and the backend to send them all to Veo 2:


Planned additional image upload UI
Now let me add the UI for uploading additional images:


Planned backend image processing logic
Perfect! Now let me update the backend to handle multiple images and send them all to Veo 2:


Planned video generation input flexibility
Now let me update the generateVideoWithVertexAI function to accept multiple images:


Decided on image upload logic
Excellent! I've implemented the multi-angle reference image system. Here's what I've done:

Frontend Updates:

âœ… Added "Additional Angles" upload field (up to 5 images)
âœ… Shows thumbnail previews of additional images with remove buttons
âœ… When Shopify product has multiple images, automatically uses all of them
âœ… Sends all images to the backend
Backend Logic:

âœ… Uploads all images to ImageKit separately
âœ… Smart duplication: If only 1 image â†’ duplicates it 3 times for Veo 2
âœ… Multiple angles: If multiple images â†’ sends each unique URL
âœ… All reference images sent to Veo 2 as referenceImages array
How it works:

Single image products: The same image URL is sent 3 times to Veo 2, giving it more "confidence"
Multi-image products: Each unique angle is sent as a separate reference image
Let me restart the application to apply these changes:


Documented multi-angle upload feature
Perfect! ðŸŽ‰ The multi-angle reference system is now live! You can see the new interface:

âœ… "Main Product Image" - Your primary product image
âœ… "Additional Angles (Optional - up to 5 images)" - Upload extra angles for better accuracy

How it Works:

Upload Flow:

Upload main image + any additional angle images
All images are uploaded to ImageKit separately
All URLs are sent to Veo 2 as reference images
Shopify Search Flow:

When you select a product from Shopify search
If the product has multiple images, all are automatically used
Main image + all additional images sent to Veo 2
Smart Duplication (Your Brilliant Idea!):

1 image only: The same URL is duplicated 3 times â†’ Veo 2 gets 3 identical references
Multiple images: Each unique angle sent separately â†’ Veo 2 sees all perspectives
Testing Instructions:

Try your carboy bottle with 1 image first (it will be tripled automatically)
Then try a Shopify product with 2-3 images
Check if Veo 2's accuracy improves with the multiple references
The system now gives Veo 2 much more data to work with. Let's test it and see if the product accuracy improves! ðŸš€
